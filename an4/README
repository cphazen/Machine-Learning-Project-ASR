This directory contains mel cepstra encoded files created from audio 
files in the Census (AN4) database.

The AN4 database was recorded at Carnegie Mellon University circa
1991. For more detailes, please see "Acoustical and environmental
robustness in automatic speech recognition", by Alex Acero, published
by Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1993.

The cepstra files were created with the following parameters:

-sampling rate 16 kHz
-mel filterbank lower frequency: 130
-mel filterbank upper frequency: 6800
-number of filters: 40
-frame rate: 100
-FFT size: 512 points
-number of cepstral coefficients: 13

The directories contain:

-feat/an4_clstk: training data set recorded on close talking microphone.

-feat/an4test_clstk: test data set recorded on close talking microphone.

-etc: directory containing the transcriptions, control files, dictionary etc.
