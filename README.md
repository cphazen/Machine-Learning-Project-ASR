# Machine Learning Project: ASR
## To do:
### Courtney:
* Update README.md with actual details

### Josh:
* Play around with variables/functionality to get more accurate output
  * Activation functions (remember to make matching derivative functions and weight alterations)
  * Learning rate
  * Layer 1 variables: mostly stride 
  * Layer 2 variables: memory dimension and threshold (depends on activation function)
* _Optional suggestions_:
  * Flesh out rev_one_hot to show most-likely results
  * Flesh out rev_binary to automatically account for a too-high threshold
