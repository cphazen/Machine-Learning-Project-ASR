# Machine Learning Project: ASR
## To do:
### Courtney:
* Test LibriSpeech functionality
* Update README.md with actual details

### Josh:
* **IMPORTANT:** Custom audio -> feature vector
* Demo function (that is, take in a wav and perform feed forward, then print output)
* Play around with variables/functionality to get more accurate output
* _Optional suggestions_:
  * Flesh out rev_one_hot to show most-likely results
  * Flesh out rev_binary to automatically account for a too-high threshold
  * Testing function
  * Add pooling/more layers to CNN
  * Alter input data for isolated word/phone alignments
